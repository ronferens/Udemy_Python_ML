## Udemy Python and Machine-Learning

This repository includes my work on Udemy's **_Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp_** course.


This is a great course by **_Jose Marcial Portilla_**!

I really liked the balanced between the lectures and the hands-on exercises. In addition, you get some very good pointers that you can use if you would like to get even more detailed explanations.

I really recommend this course to anyone how is interested in learning Python and machine-learning and also for intermediate developers that are looking to expand their knowledge.

The course covers how to use NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn , Matplotlib , Plotly , Scikit-Learn , Machine Learning, Tensorflow , and more useful libraries.
